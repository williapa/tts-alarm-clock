# TTS Alarm Clock
A simple tts alarm clock using the antd react components, and the web speech API. 

# Future plans
1. customizing the tts voice (requiring some other form inputs)
2. clearing the form once the timeout is reached and the speech is played.
3. adding a soundcloud url option (using soundcloud embedded player) so that some music can be chosen by the user. the timeout would then need to trigger the soundcloud player to start.
